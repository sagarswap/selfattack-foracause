Ransomware is one of the most critical forms of malware today and its popularity had spiked in 2021. There were 623.3 million ransomware attacks globally in 2021. Ransomware accounted for around 20% of all cyber crimes in 2022. 
Finding a way to quickly detect malware and take action will save millions of dollars that are paid to cyber criminals in return for data.

By training an ML-model off of system log and file change data, we hope to be able to train a program that can identify ransomware in action. This will be a step towards stopping the program or saving the data if applied to another program.

We set up a Linux machine with a web server, database, and Wazuh SIEM Agent. Another machine will hold the logs as the Wazuh server. 
After gathering a baseline of logs for normal operation, several different ransomware were deployed to encrypt the content folders of the website and database. 
Wazuh was then used to identify the logs that were generated by the ransomware and label them. With benign and malicious logs labeled, we exported the logs to a CSV.

After obtaining the log, analysis on the data was performed and it was noted that out of the 238 features in the log, we really only needed about 15 of them to figure out the ransomware. 
Categorical data were then encoded and continuous data were hashed.

After training out model, we got an accuracy of 99.85%, Recall of 99.76% and an F1 Score of 99.88%
